    <p>A well-organized paragraph supports or develops a single controlling idea,
         which is expressed in a sentence called the topic sentence. A topic sentence has several important functions: 
         it substantiates or supports an essayâ€™s thesis statement; it unifies the content of a paragraph and directs the order of the sentences; 
        and it advises the reader of the subject to be discussed and how the paragraph will discuss it.</p>
